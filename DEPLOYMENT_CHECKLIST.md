## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- [x] Created `vercel.json` configuration for Flask app

# If not already initialized
git init

# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Add New Project"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **File Size**: This project includes ~30MB of GeoJSON data files. Vercel has limits on build size, so consider:
  - Using CDN for large data files, OR
  - Converting to TopimbJSON (already done) to reduce size, OR
  - Using external database/storage
  
- **Cold Starts**: Flask apps on Vercel have cold start delays. First request may take 5-10 seconds.

- **API Limits**: OpenAI API usage will be billed to your account.

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

1. Open your Vercel URL
2. Test map loading
3. Test county data display
4. Test chatbot queries
5. Test map export (if working locally)

## üìù Post-Deployment

- Monitor Vercel dashboard for build logs
- Check function logs for any errors
- Monitor OpenAI API usage
